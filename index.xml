      <description>In collecting large amounts of images of the sky using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), it was inevitable that some interesting objects would be observed. Most of these were eclipsing binary stars or Cepheid variable stars. In one case, however, I observed what I believe to be a comet, specifically C/2018 N2 (ASASSN), streaking through the frame of the camera. I was writing code that strung together full-frame images (FFIs) into videos and noticed that one of the sectors had an odd point of light streaking across the detector.</description>

      <description>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the extremely luminous, supermassive black holes (SMBH) at the core of some galaxies. Active galaxies and their nuclei are classified as being active because of their extreme radiative power; however, there are many galaxies that fit under this category and they seem to be extremely varied with few similarities beyond their unbelievable luminosity. Because this class of objects is so varied, astronomers have been attempting to build a model that explains their inner structure and differences for decades.</description>

      <title>Sloan Digital Sky Survey Imaging</title>

      <description>This project is an offshoot of my main project, QuasVar, that produces beautiful astronomical images through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Dataset. Admittedly, very little processing is needed, as SDSS handles most of its data beautifully. All I did was pull images of objects in different bands, align them, and combine them in RGB to make color images. SDSS has five bands, u, g, r, i, and z, which represent ultraviolet, red, green, infrared, and far-infrared.</description>
